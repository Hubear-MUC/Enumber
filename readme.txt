Enumber 2.0
------------

This program does an enumeration of numbers between two values given as argument at the invocation.

This is supposed to be used for text files containing notes which are numbered to be able to do references between the notes. 

The output of "Enumber" looks like this:

  1.
  
  2.
  
  3.
  
  4.
  
  
assumed that you started the enumberation by one and ended it with 4.

The usage of the enumberation could look like this:

  1.
  Note number one
  
  2.
  Note number two
  
  3.
  And a third one.
  
  4.
  Fourth note, for further details also see note number 2.
  
  ...


Of course these numbers can be generated by hand with typing them in manually, which makes sense for 4 or 5 or so notes, however if the notes should contain the thoughts and ideas while working through tutorials or books with many pages several thousand notes can occurr.

So it can be useful to use the program like this:

  enumber 1 100 > notes.txt
  
to create a file  "notes.txt"  which contains the numbers for the notes from 1 to 100 where just the spaces between have to be filled with the notes themselves.

The invocation

  enumber 1 100
  
prints the numbers on the screen.

The ">" character used in a terminal window redirects the screen- output of linenumbers into a file given after, "notes.txt" in the example above.

The invocation

  enumber 101 200 >> notes.txt
  
will add another 100 numbers to the file  "notes.txt"  if it already exists.
">>" does an appending to an existing file.

The name  "enumber"  for the executable file was chosen for the examples above.

If you chose another name for the executable program at the compilation, replace the "linenumbers"- name above by the name you chose.




Version history
---------------

Version 2.0

More clearly written code;
Accidently, because I forgot that I already wrote this program earlier and "re- invented" it as "Line Numbers 1.0".
Because the new written code was more clearly to read I renamed this to "Enumber 2.0" because completely new written code deserves a countup in the mayor- version number.


Version 1.0

Initial version
